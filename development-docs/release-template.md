## Template to be copy-pasted as a template for new release notes.

<!--
  I don't make a discussion thread for every release.  Github has a button to make a discussion thread for a release.
  Then I update the discussion thread to remove the release notes and instead link to the release.
-->
Questions about this release? Ask in the official discussion thread: #TODO

<!-- only for major releases -->

*Breaking changes are prefixed with **[BREAKING]***

**Added**

- Adds description of thing added (#Issue, #PR, #etc) @contributor-name
  <!-- list any and all relevant issues and PRs in parens above; you are not limited to exactly 1 issue and 1 PR -->
  <!-- nor are you limited to linking each only once.  Sometimes a single PR pertains to multiple changelog entries; link to it from each -->
  - Optionally add details ([docs](link to docs))
  - Or multiple docs links ([CLI docs](link to docusaurus page), [API docs](link to typedoc page))

**Changed**

- **[BREAKING]** Make yadda yadda...

**Deprecated**

**Removed**

**Fixed**

- Fix #TODO: Description of fix (#Issue, #PR, #etc)

**Docs**

- In the past I've documented major improvements to docs, new docsite, new docs sections about confusing bits
- In general should avoid changelog entries that do not affect ts-node consumers

**Misc**

- In the past I've documented improvements to testing, codecov, etc.
- In general should avoid changelog entries that do not affect ts-node consumers
